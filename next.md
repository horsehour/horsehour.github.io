A *Moderate Procrastinator* is now taking actions against the Monster. The weapon is an updated schedule. Making either a short-or-long term schedule, and strictly follow it. It may not be sharp now, but at least you know what's going on and what's the next step. Never be ambitious to get rid of the badass in one day, it has been one part of you. It's not easy. Keep busy and making progress, give it no chance to dominate and drown you out.

Also, writing is good approach to keep a trace of the events. To produce a post, you have to think carefully, such that it will be a complete story without obvious flaws.
