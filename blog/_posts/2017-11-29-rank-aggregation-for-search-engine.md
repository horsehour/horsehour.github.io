title: Ranking Aggregation for Meta-Search Engine 
---

Ranking aggregation is an important approach to combine information and reach an agreement between various opinions. 
There are many applications, such as election to select a winner from a pool of candidates 
based on voters’ preference profile, or produce a full ranking or preference rate 
over a set of web pages or online movies from users’ visiting log or historical ratings. 
The report proposed two voting rules – pairwise margin voting rule and probabilistic propagation-based voting rule. 
Both methods can capture the absolute and relative position information. 
Also, we present some evaluation results of the two methods to illustrate some good properties. 
We implemented a meta search engine, 
where the proposed pairwise margin is employed to aggregate the searching results from some individual search engines.
