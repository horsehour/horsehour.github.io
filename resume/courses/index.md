This page matinas a complete list of courses that I have taken in universities.
I have a M.Sc degree in Applied Mathematics, and B.Sc degree in Information and Computing Science. 
Therefore, many of them will be math courses. Being a student in computer science, I have studied
Java (since 2011), Python (since 2016) by taking some online courses and working on some interesting
projects (e.g. write a tiny search engine from the scratch in Java, develop a comprehensive voting
libraries in Java, build a reinforcement learning based voting model to learn the internal voting 
procedure in Python).
