I am Chunheng Jiang. I am interested in machine learning (e.g. (un)supervised and
reinforcement learning), artificial intelligence (AI), information retrieval (IR),
their applications in voting (e.g. computational social choice) and ranking (e.g.
ranking learning and ranking aggregation) problems. I like to develop simple but
efficient algorithms, write codes in Java and Python, and take notes with LaTex.
You can find me at [GitHub](https://github.com/horsehour/),

me emails: jiangchunheng@gmail.com.
